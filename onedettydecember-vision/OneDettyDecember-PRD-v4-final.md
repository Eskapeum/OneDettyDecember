# OneDettyDecember Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Version: v4-final
Date: TBD
Owner: Product – OneDettyDecember

## 1. Executive Summary
### 1.1 Product Overview
OneDettyDecember is the Expedia + Airbnb + Eventbrite of Detty December—the single gateway and marketplace for travel, stays, experiences and services around West Africa’s biggest cultural season.
It aggregates verified flights, short-lets, hotels, events, tours and local services into one trusted platform for the African diaspora, locals and global Black travelers.

### 1.2 What is “Detty December”?
“Detty December” is the widely-used term for West Africa’s hyper-social holiday season, roughly from early December to early January, when the African diaspora, local elites and global Black travelers converge on cities like Lagos and Accra for back-to-back concerts, beach parties, club nights, cultural tours and family events.
The phrase comes from Nigerian pidgin (“get detty” = “go all out”), and has evolved from a local joke into a named seasonal phenomenon covered by global media (e.g. CNN Travel) and driven by Afrobeats, social media and viral travel content.
Detty December has become a recurring seasonal ecosystem that bundles travel, accommodation, events, logistics, fashion, food and social media into a concentrated 4–6 week window each year.

### 1.3 Value Proposition
- For travelers: a single, trusted place to discover, plan and book Detty December trips end-to-end, with verified events and hosts, clear pricing and community reviews.
- For locals: access to premium and affordable curated experiences without being priced out, plus tools to discover what is happening in their own city.
- For vendors and organizers: distribution, trust, payments and audience insights in one place, instead of fragmented Instagram DMs, WhatsApp chats and manual bank transfers.

### 1.4 One Detty Tribe – Community Layer
One Detty Tribe is a Facebook-like community layer that sits on top of the marketplace, where travelers, locals and vendors can form squads, share itineraries, swap recommendations and build recurring Detty December traditions.
This community layer turns a one-off trip into a durable network: people return each year to the same squads, hosts and organizers, and discover new experiences via social proof rather than random flyers.

## 2. Problem & Opportunity
Despite the hype, Detty December planning today is chaotic, fragmented and risky:
- Discovery is spread across Instagram flyers, Twitter threads, TikTok vlogs and WhatsApp broadcasts with no single source of truth.
- Travelers struggle to distinguish credible organizers from opportunistic actors; scams, poor quality events and non-refunded cancellations are common pain points.
- Prices inflate as dollar-earning diaspora arrive; locals feel excluded, while even premium travelers complain about hidden fees and inconsistent quality.
- Logistics are messy: traffic gridlock, limited parking, overloaded ride-hailing and poor coordination between multiple events in one night.
- Payments are painful for the diaspora: international cards may fail on local gateways; some organizers only accept local transfers, increasing friction and fraud risk.

The opportunity is to build the authoritative marketplace and operating system for Detty December, where discovery, trust, bookings, payments and community live in one place.

## 3. Market Opportunity
Global outlets now treat Detty December as a distinct travel and cultural phenomenon: a month-long circuit of parties, festivals, beach days, heritage tours and family events across Lagos, Accra and other hubs.
Each season, hundreds of thousands of travelers converge on these cities, driving a seasonal economy across flights, accommodation, concerts, nightlife, food, logistics, fashion and retail.
Detty December sits at the intersection of three macro trends:
- Diaspora reconnection: millions of Nigerians and Ghanaians in the US, UK, Canada and Europe now treat December homecoming as a ritual.
- African soft power: the global rise of Afrobeats and Amapiano has turned Lagos and Accra into cultural pilgrimage sites.
- Experience-first travel: a generation of travelers prioritizes immersive, social experiences over traditional, static tourism.

OneDettyDecember is positioned to capture this seasonal spike while also extending into year-round experiences, repeat visits and adjacent markets (e.g. South Africa).

## 4. User Personas (Overview)
We focus on three core personas, enriched by Detty December-specific behaviour and needs:
- Diaspora Daniel: mid-career professional in the diaspora flying in for 10–21 days, aggressively spending on flights, stays, fashion and VIP experiences but demanding international-grade quality and safety.
- Local Lola: young professional living in Lagos or Accra, keen to participate in headline events but sensitive to pricing, access and reliability.
- Vendor Victor: event organizer, host or service provider who needs reliable demand, trusted payments and tools to manage capacity and logistics.
- Community Creator Chidera: organizes squads, group trips and itineraries for friends and followers using Facebook groups, IG DMs and WhatsApp; wants one place to host her community, share plans and connect them to bookable inventory.

Detailed persona definitions (demographics, goals, behaviours and pain points) are adapted from v2.1 of the PRD and extended for the One Detty Tribe community layer.

## 5. Strategic Positioning
Existing products only cover fragments of the Detty December experience:
- Expedia / Booking.com: flights and hotels, but no Detty December curation or events.
- Airbnb / short-let platforms: accommodation, but no integrated events, logistics or community.
- Eventbrite / ticket sites: event tickets only, no travel, stays or end-to-end trip planning.
- Facebook / WhatsApp groups: community chatter with no structured discovery, verification or bookings.

OneDettyDecember is the vertical “Detty December OS” that combines:
- Expedia-style travel and inventory,
- Airbnb-style stays and experiences,
- Eventbrite-style event liquidity,
- plus One Detty Tribe – a Facebook-like community layer purpose-built for Detty December travelers, locals and vendors.

### 5.1 Marketplace Model – Demand & Supply

OneDettyDecember is explicitly a **two‑sided marketplace**.
- **Demand side:** travelers/guests (diaspora and locals) searching, discovering and booking events, stays, tours/hosted experiences, marketplace goods (art, fashion, accessories, cultural products), car rentals and transfers.
- **Supply side:** vendors, hosts, marketplace sellers/brands, creators and drivers (promoters, property owners, tour operators, micro‑hosts, local rental companies, vetted individual drivers) listing and managing inventory with payouts handled by the platform.

Every major vertical in v4 (events, stays, tours/hosted experiences, marketplace storefront, car rentals & transfers) is designed with **paired demand–supply requirements**, reflected in FR‑IDs and epics (e.g. FR‑039/040 for car rentals, FR‑041/042 for hosted experiences, FR‑045/046 for marketplace storefront).



## 6. Risk Management (Detty December-Specific)
**Economic & FX risk:** currency crises and inflation can reduce local purchasing power and make diaspora travel more expensive, muting some seasons.
- Mitigation: diversify beyond ultra-premium segments; offer mid-tier and locals-friendly offerings; expand to more markets; build year-round experiences and loyalty products.

**Perception of elitism:** media and locals critique Detty December as a dollar-driven party for elites that excludes the broader population.
- Mitigation: curate tiered experiences (free/low-cost alongside premium), highlight cultural and community offerings, and work with local partners to ensure accessible options.

**Safety, logistics and quality incidents:** overcrowding, fake events, poor safety standards and chaotic logistics can damage trust.
- Mitigation: strict vendor and event verification, clear quality standards, ratings and reviews, safety-focused product features (verified events, emergency contacts, safety tips) and curated “trusted” collections.

## 7. Appendix – Cultural Context
Detty December describes West Africa’s festive season when cities like Lagos and Accra “go detty”: a month of concerts, beach parties, club nights, cultural tours and family gatherings that attracts locals and the global African diaspora.
Coverage from outlets like CNN Travel has cemented Detty December as a named phenomenon, not just a loose cluster of events. Ghana’s “Year of Return” in 2019 further mainstreamed December in Accra for diaspora heritage tourism, while Lagos is widely seen as the nightlife and concert capital of Detty December.
The key insight is that Detty December behaves like a recurring festival season with its own culture, economy and expectations. OneDettyDecember exists to be the infrastructure and community layer that powers this season end-to-end.

- Vendor features: onboarding & verification, listing management, booking management, payouts, promotions, analytics.
- Admin features: user/vendor management, content moderation, platform analytics, financial tools.

In terms of supply verticals, the platform supports:

**New v4 Functional Requirements (Car rentals & transfers):**

- FR-039: Traveler car rentals & airport transfers
  - As a traveler, I can book an airport pickup and/or car rental as part of my Detty December stay, either during checkout or as a standalone booking.
  - As a traveler, I can see clear pricing, inclusions, pickup/drop-off locations, vehicle type and schedule before I confirm.

- FR-040: Local car rental providers & drivers
  - As a local rental provider or driver, I can create listings for vehicles and transfer services with photos, capacity, pricing, availability and pickup rules.
  - As a local rental provider or driver, I can view and manage upcoming bookings, mark completed transfers and receive payouts alongside my other OneDettyDecember earnings.

Full FR IDs and detailed acceptance criteria for these capabilities will be extended in the separate epics document (`detty-december-all-epics.md`).
**New v4 Functional Requirements (Hosted experiences / tours):**

- FR-041: Traveler booking of hosted experiences (demand side)
  - As a traveler/guest, I can discover and book locally hosted experiences (e.g. nightlife crawls, food tours, cultural walks) by date, price, location, group size and theme.
  - As a traveler/guest, I can see a clear itinerary, what’s included, the meeting point, host rating/reviews and total price before I confirm.

- FR-042: Host creation & management of experiences (supply side)
  - As a local host/vendor, I can create and manage experience listings with title, description, category, photos, meeting point, schedule, capacity, pricing and language.
  - As a local host/vendor, I can set availability, see upcoming guests, message guests and manage cancellations, within the same earnings/payout system as other marketplace supply (events, stays, tours).


**New v4 Functional Requirements (Marketplace Storefront):**

- FR-045: Traveler discovery and purchase of marketplace products
  - As a traveler/guest, I can browse and purchase products from the marketplace including Detty December-branded items, African art, fashion, accessories, beauty products, home goods, souvenirs and cultural goods by category, price, and featured collections tied to cities and events.

- FR-046: Marketplace vendor/seller storefront management
  - As a marketplace vendor, brand or creator, I can create and manage a Shopify-style storefront with product listings (title, description, photos, inventory, variants like size/color, pricing, and shipping or pickup options) and view orders and payouts in the same or a connected dashboard as my other OneDettyDecember earnings.
  - As a marketplace vendor or brand, I can participate in curated collections (e.g. "Lagos Nightlife Fits", "Accra Art & Prints", "Detty December Essentials") and see basic analytics on views, add-to-carts and sales during Detty season.

These FRs extend the marketplace beyond bookings into physical goods while still following the same two-sided demand/supply model.

These FRs make the experiences vertical explicitly **two-sided** (traveler demand vs host supply) and follow an Airbnb Experiences-style model adapted to Detty December.

**New v4 Functional Requirements (Agentic AI assistant):**

- FR-043: Agentic AI trip planner (traveler side)
  - As a traveler, I can describe my Detty December goals (dates, cities, vibe, preferred spend level, must-do events) in natural language and have an AI assistant propose an itinerary made up of real events, stays, tours/hosted experiences and mobility options from the marketplace.
  - As a traveler, I can refine the plan through a conversation (swap options, adjust how much I want to spend, change nights out vs rest days) and push selected items into my booking cart or wishlist in a few guided steps.

- FR-044: Agentic AI host/vendor copilot (supply side)
  - As a vendor/host/driver, I can be guided by an AI copilot that asks me structured questions about my event, stay, experience or car service and turns my answers into a complete listing (title, description, pricing suggestions, policies, what’s included, recommended photos).
  - As a vendor/host/driver, I can ask the copilot for suggestions on improving my listing (e.g. clearer copy, better time slots, capacity, pricing ranges) using marketplace patterns and best-practice templates, while retaining full control over final edits and publishing.

Full FR IDs and detailed acceptance criteria for these AI capabilities will also be extended in the separate epics document (`detty-december-all-epics.md`).


### AI Assistant Entry Points & Flows (MVP)

For v4 we introduce the agentic AI assistant in a small number of high-impact surfaces:
- **Traveler surfaces:** AI trip planner entry from home/landing ("Plan my Detty December"), trip dashboard and search empty states, helping users turn loose ideas into concrete itineraries made of real listings.
- **Vendor/host surfaces:** AI listing copilot entry inside the listing creation/edit flows for events, stays, hosted experiences and car rentals/transfers ("Help me write this listing"), with suggestions surfaced inline.
- **Community surfaces:** optional prompts in One Detty Tribe threads and squad planning spaces to turn shared plans into draft itineraries or shared lists of bookable items.

The assistant never replaces explicit booking or publishing actions; it proposes and structures options, while travelers and hosts make the final decisions.









In v4, we explicitly layer **One Detty Tribe** community capabilities on top of this core:
- Community spaces for cities (e.g. Lagos Tribe, Accra Tribe).
- Squad/group planning spaces for trips and event lineups.
- Lightweight social graph: follow users, see what squads and events they engage with.
- Feed of community posts tied to real listings and bookings.

Full FR IDs and detailed acceptance criteria are inherited from v2.1 and extended in the separate epics document (`detty-december-all-epics.md`).

## Technical Requirements (Non-Functional)

- NFR-013: Database read replicas for high-read workloads.
- NFR-014: CDN for static assets (images, CSS, JS).
- NFR-015: Caching layer (Redis or Supabase caching) for hot queries.

**Community & Safety Extensions (v4):**

## Success Metrics & KPIs (Extended)

We reuse the KPI framework from v2.1 and extend it for community.

**Marketplace KPIs:**
- Registered users, DAU/MAU, activated users (first booking).
- GMV, total bookings, average order value, take rate, revenue and margin.
- Active vendors, listings per vendor, vendor NPS and churn.

**Funnel & Experience KPIs:**
- Search → listing view → checkout → booking conversion.
- Repeat booking rate within 12 months.
- Time to complete end-to-end booking.

**Community KPIs (One Detty Tribe):**
- Community DAU/MAU (users who post, comment, react or join squads).
- Number of active squads and trip threads per city.
- % of bookings that originate from community surfaces (tribe feeds, squad threads).
- Retention of community users season-over-season (returning for next Detty December).

These KPIs will be tracked in product analytics (PostHog/Mixpanel) and used to prioritize roadmap decisions across marketplace and community experiences.
