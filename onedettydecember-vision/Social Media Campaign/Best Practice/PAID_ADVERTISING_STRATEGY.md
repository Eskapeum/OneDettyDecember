## 1. Objectives

*   **Accelerate Growth:** Rapidly increase brand awareness and follower growth among highly targeted audiences.
*   **Generate Qualified Leads:** Drive targeted traffic to our website, specifically to our free trial sign-up page.
*   **Retarget & Convert:** Nurture potential customers who have shown interest in Omni-Scriptr and guide them towards conversion.

## 2. Platform & Funnel Strategy

We will structure our campaigns around a classic marketing funnel, using different platforms for different stages.

### 2.1. Top of Funnel (TOFU): Awareness & Interest

*   **Goal:** Introduce Omni-Scriptr to cold audiences who have not heard of us before.
*   **Platforms:** Facebook, Instagram, YouTube.
*   **Targeting:**
    *   **Lookalike Audiences:** Create lookalike audiences based on our existing user base and website visitors.
    *   **Interest Targeting:** Target users interested in screenwriting, filmmaking, creative writing, and competitors' software (e.g., Final Draft, Celtx).
*   **Ad Formats:**
    *   **Video Ads (YouTube & Instagram Reels):** Short, engaging videos (15-60 seconds) showcasing the "magic" of Omni-Scriptr. Focus on the core value proposition, like beating writer's block.
    *   **Carousel Ads (Facebook & Instagram):** Showcase multiple features or benefits in a single ad unit.
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** "Learn More," "Watch More." We are not pushing for a sign-up at this stage.

### 2.2. Middle of Funnel (MOFU): Consideration & Evaluation

*   **Goal:** Nurture warm audiences who have shown some interest in Omni-Scriptr.
*   **Platforms:** Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn.
*   **Targeting:**
    *   **Website Retargeting:** Target users who have visited the Omni-Scriptr website but have not signed up.
    *   **Social Engagement Retargeting:** Target users who have watched our videos, liked our posts, or followed our page.
    *   **LinkedIn Targeting:** Target users by job title (e.g., "Screenwriter," "Producer") and company.
*   **Ad Formats:**
    *   **Testimonial Ads:** Short video clips or quote graphics from satisfied users.
    *   **Case Study Ads:** "See how [Writer Name] finished their script in 30 days." Drive traffic to a detailed case study on our blog.
    *   **Lead Magnet Ads:** Offer a valuable free resource (e.g., "The Ultimate Guide to Character Development," a webinar) in exchange for an email address.
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** "Download Guide," "Watch Demo," "Sign Up for Free Trial."

### 2.3. Bottom of Funnel (BOFU): Conversion

*   **Goal:** Convert hot leads into paying customers.
*   **Platforms:** Facebook, Instagram (primarily retargeting).
*   **Targeting:**
    *   **"Abandoned Cart" Retargeting:** Target users who started the sign-up process but didn't complete it.
    *   **Free Trial User Retargeting:** Target users currently in their free trial with ads showcasing advanced features to encourage an upgrade.
*   **Ad Formats:**
    *   **Direct Response Ads:** Simple, clear ads that reiterate the core benefits and push for the conversion.
    *   **Dynamic Product Ads:** Showcase specific features a user may have shown interest in.
    *   **Limited-Time Offer (LTO) Ads:** "Your free trial is ending! Upgrade now for 20% off your first year."
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** "Start Your Free Trial," "Upgrade Now."

## 3. Budget & Measurement

    *   10% for BOFU (highly targeted, smaller audience).
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
