# Omni-Scriptr Influencer Strategy

This document outlines our strategy for collaborating with influencers to build brand credibility, generate authentic content, and reach new, relevant audiences.

## 1. Objectives

*   **Build Trust & Credibility:** Leverage the authority of established industry voices to validate Omni-Scriptr as a legitimate and powerful tool.
*   **Increase Reach & Awareness:** Tap into the engaged audiences of influencers to introduce Omni-Scriptr to potential users.
*   **Drive Conversions:** Generate high-quality leads and trial sign-ups through authentic influencer endorsements and affiliate marketing.

## 2. Influencer Tiers & Identification

We will categorize influencers into three tiers to manage relationships and campaigns effectively.

*   **Tier 1: Macro-Influencers (50k-500k+ followers)**
    *   **Who they are:** Well-known screenwriters, directors, YouTubers who create content about filmmaking (e.g., "Lessons from the Screenplay," "StudioBinder").
    *   **How we'll find them:** Industry research, YouTube searches, monitoring guest lists on popular writing podcasts.
    *   **Collaboration Type:** Paid partnerships, dedicated video reviews, brand ambassadorships.

*   **Tier 2: Micro-Influencers (5k-50k followers)**
    *   **Who they are:** Professional but less famous writers, script consultants, film school professors, and niche content creators (e.g., a writer who specializes in sci-fi and has a popular blog).
    *   **How we'll find them:** Hashtag research (#screenwriting, #scriptchat), LinkedIn searches, exploring followers of Tier 1 influencers.
    *   **Collaboration Type:** Product-for-review exchanges, affiliate marketing, sponsored content (e.g., a series of tweets or an Instagram post), guest blog posts.

*   **Tier 3: Nano-Influencers & Power Users (500-5k followers)**
    *   **Who they are:** Our own most active and enthusiastic users, emerging writers who are active in online communities.
    *   **How we'll find them:** Monitoring our social media mentions, our Facebook community, and our most active product users.
    *   **Collaboration Type:** Affiliate codes, beta access to new features, co-hosting community events (e.g., a Q&A), featuring them in a "User Spotlight."
