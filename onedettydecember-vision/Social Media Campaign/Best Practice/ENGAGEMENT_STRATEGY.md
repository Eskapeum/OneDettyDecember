# Omni-Scriptr Engagement Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for engaging with our community on social media. Proactive and positive engagement is crucial for building trust, fostering loyalty, and turning followers into brand advocates.

## 1. Core Principles

*   **Be Responsive:** Aim to respond to all legitimate comments, questions, and mentions within 24 hours on weekdays.
*   **Be Human:** Avoid generic, corporate responses. Use a friendly, approachable, and authentic tone. Use emojis where appropriate to convey personality.
*   **Be Helpful:** Always look for opportunities to provide value, whether it's answering a question about the product or offering a piece of writing advice.
*   **Be Proactive:** Don't just wait for people to talk to you. Actively seek out and participate in relevant conversations.

## 2. Engagement Protocols

### 2.1. Responding to Comments & Mentions

*   **Positive Feedback & Mentions:**
    *   **Action:** Like and reply to all positive comments. Thank the user for their kind words.
    *   **Proactive Step:** If they share a success story, ask for permission to feature it as a testimonial or success story.
*   **Questions:**
    *   **Action:** Provide a clear and concise answer. If the question is complex, direct them to a relevant blog post, tutorial, or our support channel.
    *   **Proactive Step:** If a question is asked frequently, turn the answer into a piece of content (e.g., a "Quick Tip" graphic or video).
*   **Negative Feedback & Criticism:**
    *   **Action:** Respond publicly to show you are listening. Acknowledge their frustration and apologize for the negative experience.
    *   **Action:** Move the conversation to a private channel (DM or email) to resolve the specific issue. Use a phrase like, "We're sorry to hear you're having trouble. Could you please DM us with your account details so we can investigate this for you?"
    *   **NEVER:** Delete negative comments unless they are spam or violate community guidelines.

### 2.2. Community Management (Facebook Group & Forums)

*   **Daily Prompts:** Post a daily discussion question to encourage interaction.
*   **Weekly Threads:** Create weekly threads for members to share their work and request feedback (e.g., "Feedback Friday").
*   **Moderation:** Enforce community guidelines to ensure the group remains a safe and constructive environment. Remove spam and address any conflicts respectfully.
*   **Exclusive Content:** Share exclusive tips, feature previews, and host live Q&As specifically for group members to reward their participation.

### 2.3. Proactive Engagement

*   **Hashtag Monitoring:** Actively monitor relevant hashtags (#screenwriting, #writingcommunity, #filmmaking, #amwriting) and join conversations where we can provide value.
*   **Influencer & Brand Interaction:** Regularly comment on and share content from industry influencers, complementary brands, and our own power users.
*   **Social Listening:** Use social listening tools to identify conversations about our brand and our competitors. Use these insights to engage with potential customers and address any misconceptions.

## 3. User-Generated Content (UGC)

*   **Encourage Creation:** Actively encourage users to share their work and experiences with Omni-Scriptr using a branded hashtag (e.g., #OmniScripted).
*   **Request Permission:** Always request permission from the user before re-sharing their content on our official channels.
*   **Give Credit:** Always tag and credit the original creator in the caption when re-sharing UGC.
*   **Reward Participation:** Feature the "best of UGC" in a weekly or monthly roundup post to celebrate our community and encourage more sharing.
