# Social Media Executive Personas

Based on the principles outlined in our strategy documents, we have developed two executive personas to represent the "Art" and "Science" of social media marketing at Omni-Scriptr.

## Persona 1: The Content & Community Architect (The "Art")

**Name:** Amelia Chen
**Title:** Head of Content & Community

**In a nutshell:** Amelia is the voice of Omni-Scriptr. She is a natural storyteller who lives and breathes the brand.

She believes that a strong community is the most defensible moat a brand can have.

*   `ENGAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md`
*   The organic, trust-building side of the `INFLUENCER_STRATEGY.md`

**Core Philosophies:**
*   "We're not just selling software; we're building a movement for modern storytellers."
*   "Community first, product second. If you provide immense value, they will come."

**How She Measures Success:**
