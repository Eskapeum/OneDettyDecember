## 🚨 CRITICAL BRAND MESSAGING

### **ALWAYS REMEMBER:**

**OneDettyDecember operates in TWO cities:**
- 🇳🇬 **Lagos, Nigeria**
- 🇬🇭 **Accra, Ghana**

**BOTH cities must be represented equally in all content.**

---

## ✅ CORRECT MESSAGING

### **When mentioning locations:**

✅ "Lagos AND Accra"  
✅ "Lagos 🇳🇬 & Accra 🇬🇭"  
✅ "Two cities, one incredible experience"  
✅ "Experience Detty December in both Lagos and Accra"  
✅ "West Africa's entertainment capitals"

### **When describing the experience:**

✅ "Detty December happens in Lagos, Nigeria AND Accra, Ghana"  
✅ "Plan your trip to both cities"  
✅ "From Lagos beaches to Accra nightlife"  
✅ "Experience the best of both cities"

### **Hashtag usage:**

✅ Always include BOTH: #Lagos #Accra  
✅ Always include BOTH: #Nigeria #Ghana  
✅ Use: #WestAfrica (not just one country)

---

## ❌ INCORRECT MESSAGING

### **DO NOT:**

❌ "Lagos during Detty December..." (without mentioning Accra)  
❌ "Nigeria's biggest celebration" (it's both Nigeria AND Ghana)  
❌ Focus only on Lagos in visuals  
❌ Focus only on Accra in visuals  
❌ Use only #Lagos or only #Accra  
❌ Say "Africa's party capital" referring to only one city

## 🎨 VISUAL GUIDELINES

### **Content Balance:**

**For every piece of content:**
- If showing Lagos, also show Accra (or vice versa)
- Split-screen designs should feature both cities equally
- Video montages should include scenes from both cities
- Photo carousels should alternate between cities

**Examples:**
- TikTok video: Show Lagos street → Accra landmark → Lagos beach → Accra nightlife
- Instagram carousel: Slide 1 (Lagos) → Slide 2 (Accra) → Slide 3 (Lagos) → etc.
- Pinterest boards: Include pins from both cities

### **City-Specific Content:**

**When creating content about ONE city specifically:**
- Clearly label it: "Lagos Spotlight" or "Accra Guide"
- Mention the other city in caption: "Stay tuned for our Accra guide!"
- Balance it out: If you post Lagos content today, post Accra content tomorrow

- Make stereotypical jokes about either country

## ✅ CONTENT CHECKLIST

**Before posting ANY content, verify:**

- [ ] Does it mention BOTH Lagos and Accra? (or is it clearly labeled as city-specific?)
- [ ] Do visuals represent both cities equally?
- [ ] Are both country flags used? 🇳🇬🇬🇭
- [ ] Do hashtags include both #Lagos and #Accra?
- [ ] Does the caption acknowledge both cities?
- [ ] Is the tone respectful to both cultures?

## 🚨 EMERGENCY CORRECTIONS

**If you realize content was posted with only one city:**

1. **DO NOT delete** (engagement is valuable)
2. **Post a follow-up** immediately featuring the other city
3. **Add a comment** on the original post: "And don't forget Accra! 🇬🇭 [or Lagos 🇳🇬]"
4. **Update future content** to balance it out

---

## 📊 CONTENT BALANCE TRACKING

**Weekly Check:**
- Count Lagos-focused posts
- Count Accra-focused posts
- Ensure 50/50 balance (or close to it)

**Monthly Review:**
- Analyze which city gets more engagement
- Adjust content strategy to boost the other
- Ensure equal representation in all campaigns
