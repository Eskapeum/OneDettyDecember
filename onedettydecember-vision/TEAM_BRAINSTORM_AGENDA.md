## Agenda

### Part 1: Context Setting (10 minutes)

**Facilitator opens with:**
> "We've found an incredible luxury template (NOIR Haute Couture) that gives us world-class animations and UX. The key decision: we're keeping the structure and animations, but **completely replacing** the minimalist black/white/gray colors with our vibrant OneDettyDecember brand."

**Show:**
- Quick demo of NOIR template (scroll through sections)
- Current OneDettyDecember landing page (http://localhost:3002)
- Brand color palette side-by-side comparison

**Key Point:** This is NOT about "should we use a template" - it's about "how do we inject our cultural energy into this professional foundation."
