## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Why This Is Urgent:
1. **Nigeria operates first-to-file system** - Whoever files first gets the trademark, regardless of who used it first
2. **Prevent brand hijacking** - Competitors could register "OneDettyDecember" before you
3. **Enable investor funding** - Strong IP protection increases valuation
4. **Block copycats** - Legally stop competitors from using similar names

### What Happens If You Don't File Now:
❌ Competitor registers "OneDettyDecember" first  
❌ Forced to rebrand (expensive, confusing)  
❌ No legal recourse against infringers  
❌ Lower business valuation  
❌ Difficult international expansion  

---

## 🎯 DEFENSIVE REGISTRATIONS (Optional Phase 2)

Consider also registering these variants to prevent cybersquatting:
- **OnDettyDecember** (common misspelling)
- **1DettyDecember** (numeric variant)
- **DettyDecemberOne** (reverse order)
- **ODD** (acronym)

**Cost:** ₦240,000 - ₦320,000 per variant (5 classes each)

---
