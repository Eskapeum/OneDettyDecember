### Thread: "The Complete History of Detty December"

**TWEET 1 (Thread starter):**
```
The complete history of Detty December 🧵

How a diaspora homecoming became West Africa's biggest cultural celebration (and why you need to experience it)

Let's dive in 👇
```

**TWEET 2:**
```
First, what is Detty December?

It's the annual cultural celebration that takes over Lagos 🇳🇬 and Accra 🇬🇭 every December.

Think: Non-stop Afrobeats concerts, beach parties, boat cruises, cultural experiences, and unforgettable vibes from Dec 20 - Jan 5.
```

**TWEET 3:**
```
The origin story:

Early 2010s: Diaspora Nigerians and Ghanaians (UK, US, Canada) started returning home for Christmas in larger numbers.

What began as family reunions evolved into coordinated friend group trips, then full-blown cultural events.
```

**TWEET 4:**
```
The name 'Detty December' comes from Nigerian Pidgin:

'Detty' = Dirty (in a good way—wild, unfiltered, unapologetic fun)
'December' = The month it all goes down

Basically: December gets WILD in Lagos and Accra. Hence, Detty December.
```

**TWEET 5:**
```
Why December specifically?

1. Diaspora holiday break (Christmas/New Year)
2. Perfect weather in West Africa (dry season)
3. End-of-year celebration energy
4. Afrobeats artists schedule major concerts
5. Everyone's in the mood to party and reconnect
```

**TWEET 6:**
```
The turning point: 2015-2017

Afrobeats went global. Wizkid, Davido, Burna Boy started selling out international venues.

Diaspora wanted to experience these artists at HOME, in Lagos and Accra, where the culture was born.

Detty December exploded.
```

**TWEET 7:**
```
What happens during Detty December?

🎵 Concerts (Burna Boy, Wizkid, Davido, Asake, Tems)
🏖️ Beach club parties (Landmark, Ilashe, Labadi)
🚤 Boat cruises on Lagos Lagoon
🍽️ Food tours (jollof, suya, waakye)
🎨 Art galleries & cultural sites
🛍️ Shopping (Lekki Market, Makola Market)
```

**TWEET 8:**
```
Lagos vs Accra vibes:

🇳🇬 LAGOS: High-energy, non-stop nightlife, luxury beach clubs, massive concerts, hustle culture

🇬🇭 ACCRA: Laid-back, beach-focused, wellness retreats, cultural experiences, chill vibes

Pro tip: Do BOTH cities in one trip for the full experience.
```

**TWEET 9:**
```
Who goes to Detty December?

✈️ Diaspora (UK, US, Canada, Europe)
🏠 Locals (Nigerians & Ghanaians)
🌍 International travelers (curious about African culture)
👥 Squads, couples, solo travelers
🎉 Ages 21-45 (mostly millennials & Gen Z)

Everyone's welcome.
```

**TWEET 10:**
```
The economic impact:

Detty December generates millions in revenue for:
- Hotels & Airbnbs
- Event promoters
- Restaurants & clubs
- Local vendors
- Transportation
- Tourism industry

It's become a major economic driver for both countries.
```

**TWEET 11:**
```
Why it matters beyond the parties:
