---

### 3.5 Trademark Registration Process - Step by Step

#### **STEP 1: Appoint Accredited Trademark Agent**

**Requirement:** Nigerian law mandates that trademark applications must be filed through an accredited agent or attorney registered with the Nigerian Trademarks Registry.

**Action Required:**
- Select and engage a reputable trademark attorney
- Execute Power of Attorney in favor of the attorney (no notarization required in Nigeria)
- Provide attorney with:
  - Full company name and address
  - Applicant information (directors/owners)
  - Trademark representations (logos in JPEG, min 1200 dpi)
  - List of goods/services for each class

**Recommended Firms:**
- Lex Artifex LLP (Lagos) - Specializes in tech/startup IP
- Ibe Chido & Associates (Lagos) - Corporate IP specialists
- Banwo & Ighodalo (Lagos) - Full-service IP law firm
- Veraz Advocates (Abuja) - Government-connected IP practice

**Cost Estimate:** ₦50,000 - ₦150,000 per class (attorney fees)

---

#### **STEP 2: Preliminary Trademark Search**

**Purpose:** Ensure OneDettyDecember is available and does not conflict with existing trademarks

**Process:**
- Attorney conducts manual search at Nigerian Trademarks Registry (Abuja)
- Search covers:
  - Identical marks
  - Confusingly similar marks
  - Phonetic similarities
  - Visual similarities
- Search performed across all relevant trademark classes

**Timeline:** 3-7 business days

**Search Results Will Show:**
- Existing registrations that may conflict
- Pending applications that could block registration
- Likelihood of registration success
- Recommended modifications (if needed)

**Cost:** ₦20,000 - ₦50,000 (typically included in attorney's fees)

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT skip this step. Filing without a search wastes time and money if the mark is already taken.

---

#### **STEP 3: File Trademark Application**

**Process:**
- Attorney prepares Form TM2 (Application for Trademark Registration)
- Submit electronically via Nigerian Industrial Property Office (NIPO) portal
- OR submit manually at Registry office in Abuja

**Application Must Include:**
1. Completed Form TM2
2. Power of Attorney (signed by applicant, no notarization needed)
3. Representation of trademark:
   - Word marks: Text format
   - Logo marks: JPEG format, minimum 1200 dpi resolution
4. List of goods/services in each class (using Nice Classification descriptions)
5. Applicant details:
   - Full legal name
   - Nationality
   - Physical address (Nigerian address for Nigerian companies)
6. Priority claim (if claiming foreign priority under Paris Convention)
7. Payment evidence (see fees below)

**Filing Methods:**
- **Electronic Filing:** Via NIPO e-filing portal (recommended - faster processing)
- **Manual Filing:** Physical submission at Registry

**Official Government Fees (Per Class):**
- Application filing fee: ₦10,000
- Acceptance fee: ₦10,000
- Advertisement fee: ₦5,000
- Registration/Certificate fee: ₦15,000
- **TOTAL per class:** ₦40,000

**For 5 Classes (35, 39, 41, 43, 9):**
- Government fees: ₦200,000
- Attorney fees: ₦250,000 - ₦750,000 (depending on firm and complexity)
- **TOTAL ESTIMATED:** ₦450,000 - ₦950,000

**Timeline:** Same-day acknowledgment for e-filing; 1-2 weeks for manual filing

**Output:** Trademark Registration Acknowledgement Form (receipt of application)

---

#### **STEP 4: Examination by Registrar**

**What Happens:**
The Trademarks Registry examines the application to ensure compliance with legal requirements.

**Two-Stage Examination:**

**1. Formal Examination (3-5 weeks)**
- Verifies all forms completed correctly
- Confirms payment received
- Checks Power of Attorney is valid
- Reviews trademark representation quality

**2. Substantive Examination (6-12 weeks)**
- Assesses trademark distinctiveness
- Checks for conflicts with existing marks
- Ensures mark is not:
  - Generic or descriptive
  - Deceptive or misleading
  - Immoral or offensive
  - Identical/similar to existing marks in same class
  - Prohibited under Nigerian law

**Possible Outcomes:**

**A. Acceptance:**
- Registry issues Trademark Acceptance Letter
- Application proceeds to publication
- Timeline: 3-5 weeks from filing (well-prepared applications)

**B. Objection/Office Action:**
- Registry raises concerns about registrability
- Applicant has opportunity to respond
- Common objections:
  - Mark is descriptive
  - Conflict with prior registration
  - Insufficient distinctiveness
  - Need for disclaimers
- Response deadline: Usually 2 months
- Timeline: Adds 2-4 months to process

**C. Rejection:**
- Registry refuses application
- Right to appeal to Trademarks Tribunal
- Rarely happens if proper preliminary search conducted

---

#### **STEP 5: Publication in Trademark Journal**

**Trigger:** Upon acceptance by Registry

**What Happens:**
- Trademark is published in the **Nigerian Trademark Journal**
- Journal published periodically (monthly/quarterly)
- Publication serves as public notice of pending registration

**Opposition Window:**
- **2 months** from date of publication
- Third parties may file Notice of Opposition if they believe:
  - Mark infringes their earlier rights
  - Mark is confusingly similar to their brand
  - They have common law rights to the name
  - Registration would damage their business

**Opposition Process (If Occurs):**
1. Third party files Notice of Opposition
2. Applicant receives notice and may file Counter-Statement
3. Both parties submit evidence
4. Trademark Tribunal hears case
5. Decision issued (can take 6-12 additional months)
6. Appeals possible to Federal High Court

**Statistics:**
- Approximately 5-10% of applications face opposition
- Most oppositions settle out of court
- Well-differentiated brands rarely face opposition

**Cost if Opposed:**
- Opposition defense: ₦200,000 - ₦500,000+ (attorney fees)
- Potential settlement costs
- Lost time (6-18 months additional)

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Conduct thorough preliminary search
- Choose distinctive, unique name
- Avoid descriptive terms
- Register early (before brand becomes public)

---

#### **STEP 6: Registration Certificate Issuance**

**Trigger:** Opposition period expires with no objections (or opposition resolved in applicant's favor)

**Process:**
- Registrar verifies all fees paid
- Registrar enters trademark in Register of Trademarks
- Registration Certificate issued

**Certificate Contains:**
- Trademark registration number
- Trademark owner details
- Trademark representation
- Goods/services covered
- Class(es) of registration
- Date of application (priority date)
- Date of registration
- Expiry date (7 years from filing date)

**Timeline from Filing:**
- **Unopposed applications:** 6-12 months total
- **Opposed applications:** 12-24 months (or longer)

**Legal Effect:**
- Exclusive right to use trademark for registered goods/services
- Right to prevent others from using confusingly similar marks
- Right to license trademark
- Right to assign trademark
- Basis for expanding to other jurisdictions
- Presumption of ownership in disputes

---

- Loss of exclusive rights
- Anyone can apply to register same/similar mark
- May be difficult/impossible to re-register if competitor files first

**CRITICAL:** Set calendar reminders 6 months before expiry dates. Maintain organized renewal schedule.

---

### 3.8 Color vs. Black & White Registration

#### **Black & White Registration:**
**Advantages:**
- Protects mark in ALL color combinations
- Maximum flexibility for brand evolution
- Easier to enforce (broader protection)

**When to Use:**
- Primary word marks
- Logos that may change colors over time

**Example:** Registering "OneDettyDecember" in black & white means you can use it in any color.

#### **Color Registration:**
**Advantages:**
- Protects specific color scheme
- Useful for distinctive brand colors

**Limitations:**
- Protection limited to registered colors only
- Less flexible for brand evolution
- Harder to enforce

**When to Use:**
- Distinctive color combinations that are essential to brand identity
- When colors themselves are part of brand recognition (e.g., Coca-Cola red)

**Recommendation for OneDettyDecember:**
- Register word mark "OneDettyDecember" in **black & white** (flexibility)
- Register logo with specific colors (if colors are distinctive and consistent)
- This provides both breadth and specificity of protection

---

## 4. COPYRIGHT REGISTRATION STRATEGY

### 4.1 Understanding Copyright in Nigeria

#### **Legal Framework:**
- **Copyright Act, CAP C28, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004**
- **Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC)** - Regulatory authority
- **Automatic Protection:** Copyright exists automatically upon creation (no registration required)
- **Voluntary Registration:** NCC operates voluntary registration scheme for evidential purposes

#### **Why Register Copyright?**
While copyright exists automatically, registration provides:
1. **Prima facie evidence** of ownership in court
2. **Public record** of creation date and authorship
3. **Deterrent effect** against infringement
4. **Easier enforcement** in legal disputes
5. **Professional credibility** with investors/partners
6. **Basis for licensing** and monetization

#### **Duration of Copyright:**
- **Literary, artistic, musical works:** Life of author + 70 years

### 8.1 IP Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**Impact:** HIGH - Could be blocked from using OneDettyDecember brand

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ File trademark applications immediately (within 30 days)
- ✅ Conduct thorough preliminary search
- ✅ Monitor trademark journal for similar applications
- ✅ Consider filing provisional application while finalizing brand

**Contingency:**
- If similar mark found, negotiate with owner
- Consider filing opposition
- Rebrand if necessary (costly but better than litigation)

---

#### **RISK 2: Office Action/Objection from Registry**

**Probability:** Low-Medium (10-20% of applications)

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Delays registration, increases costs

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Choose distinctive, non-descriptive name
- ✅ Work with experienced trademark attorney
- ✅ Ensure proper classification of services
- ✅ Include disclaimers if needed (e.g., "Detty December" may need disclaimer)

**Contingency:**
- Respond promptly to office actions
- Modify application if needed
- Provide evidence of distinctiveness/acquired secondary meaning

---

#### **RISK 3: Third-Party Opposition**

**Probability:** Low (5-10% of applications)

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Significant delays (6-18 months), increased costs

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Thorough preliminary search to identify potential conflicts
- ✅ Choose unique brand name
- ✅ Early soft launch with minimal publicity (before filing)
- ✅ Monitor potential competitors

**Contingency:**
- Negotiate settlement with opposing party
- Defend opposition with evidence of prior use/distinctiveness

- Abandon application and rebrand (last resort)

---

#### **RISK 4: Copyright Infringement (Someone Copies Platform Design)**

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Choose distinctive primary mark (OneDettyDecember vs. just "Detty December")
- ✅ Add unique elements (logo, tagline)
- ✅ Build secondary meaning through consistent use and marketing
- ✅ Include disclaimer if required (e.g., "No claim to exclusive use of 'Detty December'")

## 9. POST-REGISTRATION MANAGEMENT

### 9.1 Trademark Usage Guidelines

Once trademarks are registered, proper use is critical to maintain rights:

#### **Correct Usage:**
- ✅ Use ® symbol after registered marks (after registration completes)
- ✅ Use ™ symbol for unregistered marks or during application period
- ✅ Use trademark as adjective, not noun or verb
  - Correct: "Book your trip on the OneDettyDecember™ platform"
  - Incorrect: "OneDettyDecember your trip"
- ✅ Distinguish trademark from surrounding text (capitalization, bold, color)
- ✅ Use trademark consistently in same form as registered

#### **Incorrect Usage (Risks Losing Rights):**
- ❌ Using trademark as generic term
- ❌ Failing to use ® symbol (after registration)
- ❌ Modifying trademark significantly from registered form
- ❌ Allowing trademark to become verb (e.g., "to google")
- ❌ Not policing unauthorized use by others

---

Include proper copyright notices on all materials:

**Format:** © [Year] OneDettyDecember Limited. All rights reserved.

**Where to Display:**
- Website footer (every page)
- App "About" section

### 9.3 Record-Keeping Best Practices

#### **Digital Records:**
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox) with:

#### **Database/Spreadsheet:**
Create IP management spreadsheet tracking:

|-----------|------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| OneDettyDecember | Trademark | TM12345 | Class 35 | 01/01/2026 | 06/15/2026 | 01/01/2033 | Registered |
| Platform Code v1.0 | Copyright | LW00123 | Literary | 01/15/2026 | 03/10/2026 | N/A | Registered |

---

### 9.4 International Expansion Strategy

Once Nigerian registrations complete, consider expanding protection:

#### **Phase 1: West Africa (Years 2-3)**
- **Ghana:** File separate trademark application (costs similar to Nigeria)
- **Benin, Togo, Senegal:** Consider OAPI (African Intellectual Property Organization) trademark

#### **Phase 2: Major Markets (Years 3-5)**
- **United States:** File via USPTO (if targeting US diaspora)
- **United Kingdom:** File via UKIPO (if targeting UK diaspora)
- **Canada:** File via CIPO (if targeting Canadian diaspora)

#### **Phase 3: Global (Years 5+)**
- **Madrid Protocol:** International trademark registration system
  - Single application covers 100+ countries
  - More cost-effective than filing separately
  - Requires existing Nigerian registration as basis

**Estimated Costs:**
- Ghana: ₦200,000 - ₦400,000 per mark
- US: $1,500 - $3,000 per mark (₦2,000,000 - ₦4,000,000)
- UK: £700 - £1,500 per mark (₦1,400,000 - ₦3,000,000)
- Madrid Protocol: $1,000 - $2,000 per mark + $100 per designated country
