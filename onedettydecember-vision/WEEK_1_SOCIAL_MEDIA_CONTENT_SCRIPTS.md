Let's dive in 👇"

**TWEET 2:**
"First, what is Detty December?

It's the annual cultural celebration that takes over Lagos 🇳🇬 and Accra 🇬🇭 every December.

Think: Non-stop Afrobeats concerts, beach parties, boat cruises, cultural experiences, and unforgettable vibes from Dec 20 - Jan 5."

**TWEET 3:**

Early 2010s: Diaspora Nigerians and Ghanaians (UK, US, Canada) started returning home for Christmas in larger numbers.

What began as family reunions evolved into coordinated friend group trips, then full-blown cultural events."

**TWEET 4:**
"The name 'Detty December' comes from Nigerian Pidgin:

'Detty' = Dirty (in a good way—wild, unfiltered, unapologetic fun)
'December' = The month it all goes down

Basically: December gets WILD in Lagos and Accra. Hence, Detty December."

**TWEET 5:**
"Why December specifically?

1. Diaspora holiday break (Christmas/New Year)

3. End-of-year celebration energy
4. Afrobeats artists schedule major concerts
5. Everyone's in the mood to party and reconnect"

**TWEET 6:**
"The turning point: 2015-2017

Afrobeats went global. Wizkid, Davido, Burna Boy started selling out international venues.

Diaspora wanted to experience these artists at HOME, in Lagos and Accra, where the culture was born.

Detty December exploded."
