### **SLIDE 14: RISK MITIGATION**

**Headline:** *"We've Thought Through the Risks"*

**Potential Risks & Our Mitigation:**

**Risk 1: Seasonality (Detty December is Dec only)**

**Mitigation:**
- Expand to year-round events (Easter, Independence Day, Carnival, etc.)
- Corporate retreats and business travel
- Early booking incentives (sell Dec 2027 in Jan 2027)
- Expand to other West African markets with different peak seasons

**Risk 2: Big Players Enter (Viator, Airbnb compete)**

**Response:**
- They won't (0.18% of their TAM, not worth it)
- Cultural curation is not their strength
- By the time they notice, we own the category
- Local relationships take years to build
- We move fast and lock in vendors

**Risk 3: Economic Downturn**

**Mitigation:**
- Customers are diaspora (paid in USD/GBP/EUR, not naira)
- Diaspora spending increases during local economic challenges
- Price in USD, hedge FX risk
- Target middle-income diaspora, not just ultra-wealthy

**Risk 4: Vendor Quality Issues**

**Mitigation:**
- Strict vetting process (site visits, background checks)
- Performance monitoring (reviews, complaints)
- Bonding/insurance requirements
- Escrow payments (vendors paid after delivery)
- 24/7 concierge + money-back guarantee

**Risk 5: Payment Fraud**

**Mitigation:**
- Use established payment processors (Paystack, Stripe)
- 3D Secure authentication
- Fraud detection algorithms
- Escrow system protects both sides
- Insurance partnerships

**Risk 6: Competition from Social Media (Instagram/WhatsApp)**

**Response:**
- We're not competing - we're building the infrastructure they lack
- Discovery happens on Instagram, booking happens on OneDettyDecember
- We're where transactions happen securely
- Instagram is for inspiration, we're for execution
