🌍 if One Detty December is the product, then Tobi Adelaja is the visionary brand behind it — and how he positions himself now can define not only the product’s success this year, but his long-term image as a cultural-tech pioneer in Africa.

Below is a strategic PR roadmap — a complete breakdown of how he and his team can leverage One Detty December into massive brand authority, partnerships, and media visibility.


🔥 1. BRAND Tobi ADELJA as “The Face of Africa’s Detty-Tech Revolution”

Positioning statement:

> “Tobi Adelaja — the visionary bridging the global diaspora with West Africa’s biggest cultural season through technology.”


How to do it:

Make him the spokesperson for Detty December '25— where culture meets tech.

Emphasize his why: he created this because he saw the confusion and wanted to make travel, culture, and celebration easier for millions.

Use phrases like:

“Digital Detty Revolution”

“Africa’s Cultural-Tech Connector”

“From Lagos to London — one click, one culture, one Detty December.”


📸 2. EXECUTE A 6-WEEK MEDIA BLITZ (Pre-Launch → Post-Launch)

a. Press & Media

Pitch and publish:

Press Release (to national & lifestyle outlets — The Guardian, Punch, BusinessDay, etc

Exclusive Founder Interview — “The Man Behind One Detty December.”

b. Digital PR

Appear on top podcasts if possible.

Partner with influencers and travel bloggers — sponsor “Detty Diaries.”


c. TV & Radio

Hotels & Villas — secure exclusive deals.

Event promoters — offer verified listings, VIP access.

Tourism Boards (Nigerian Tourism, Ghana Tourism) — pitch as digital ambassador for cultural tourism.


Each partnership becomes a PR story:

> “One Detty December partners with Emirates to offer exclusive diaspora packages.”

🌐 4. DOMINATE SOCIAL MEDIA WITH SMART CAMPAIGNS

Campaign Ideas

1. #MyDettyStory — invite users to share past Detty December memories.


2. #OneDettyChallenge — users post how they plan to go “One Detty” this December.


3. Countdown Series — “30 Days of Detty” — daily content showcasing events, food, beaches, nightlife.


4. Behind the Visionary mini-doc — 2-minute cinematic video introducing Tobi’s vision, released across Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts.


🎤 5. OWN THE “Detty December Data”

Nothing earns credibility faster than insights.

Publish the “One Detty December Report” — e.g.,

> “Over $150 million spent on travel, hospitality, and entertainment during Detty December 2024.”
Include stats, trends, and predictions for 2025.


That makes Tobi the go-to authority every journalist calls for quotes on December tourism.

💼 6. ACTIVATE DIASPORA COMMUNITIES

Target:

Nigerian & Ghanaian communities abroad (UK, US, Canada).

Use local influencers and diaspora travel agencies to co-host virtual sessions:

> “Planning your 2025 Detty December — the Smart Way.”


Use these sessions to onboard travelers early and collect user data for launch.

🏆 7. CREATE THE “ONE DETTY SUMMIT” (2026 Vision)

In 2026, host the first-ever One Detty Summit — bringing together:

Event organizers

…to discuss the business of Detty December.
This makes him the thought leader of an entire emerging industry: Detty Tourism Economy.
